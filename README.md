# SVG Logo Maker (Mod-10-Challenge)

# Professional README Generator (Mod-9-Challenge)

## Description

Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker, or Module 10's Challenge, is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The command-line application will ask for a shape (circle, triangle, or square), shape color (or hexadecimal), text (up to 3 characters), and a text color. This challenge will test our ability to utilize the command-line and node.js, constructors, tests, use inquirer and jest, and generating SVG files.

## Installation

Create new repository and begin code from scratch by creating a main index.js file and a folder for supporting shape.js, shapes.test.js and questions.js files. Installation also includes a .gitignore file, node_modules and package.json from npm install of inquirer v8.2.6 and jest, and an example folder for logo.svg generated files.
